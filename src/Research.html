            This paper is from my senior capstone project from Bridgewater College. It involved the use of the glowscript 
            (a combination of python and Javascript) to simulate XRD analysis on crystalline materials. The project ran for about 
            20 weeks and concluded with this paper and an oral presentation in front of classmates and physics departments leaders.<br><br>
            &emsp; This was a very fun project for me because it was different from many of the more lab-based projects that I had worked on previously, 
            but instead allowed me to use much more of my computer science knowledge. Many of the ideas that I learned from my data structure and algorithms class 
            were used in this project to improve runtime and resource managment.<br><br>
            &emsp; This was also the first big project I worked on after learning LaTeX, so I was able to create a much more professional looking paper than previous 
            projects I worked on before.

          The following is a project I worked on over the summer between my sophomore and junior year. I performed this project at Clemson University's 
          Advanced Materials Research Lab (AMRL) and it was funded through the Clemson SURE program and the National Science Foundation. This research involved 
          studying a new method for producing semiconductor fibers by using post heat treatments.<br><br>
          &emsp; This was one my favorite projects I have worked on, the AMRL facility was well funded and it also housed the Clemson electron microscope lab which 
          I used frequently for my project.<br><br>
          &emsp; This project also involved a final paper, as well as, a presentation in front of fellow SURE program memebrs and staff of the Clemson science 
          and engineering departments. The project also involved presentation at a poster session (see poster below) at which I recieved the award for top project in 
          my program.
